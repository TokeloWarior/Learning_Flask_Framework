# üêç Flask Learning Journey

This repository documents my complete journey of learning the Flask web framework using Python.  
It is based on a structured approach inspired by a comprehensive Flask development book.

The goal is to build a deep understanding of how Flask works ‚Äî from setup to deployment ‚Äî by following each chapter and implementing my own examples along the way.
